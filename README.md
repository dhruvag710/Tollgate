# Tollgate

A self-hosted, OpenAI-compatible LLM gateway. Point your OpenAI SDK at Tollgate by
changing only `base_url`. See [SPEC.md](SPEC.md) for the full design.

**Status:** phases 1.1–1.3: passthrough for streaming and non-streaming chat
completions, and the mock provider. Auth, rate limiting and the persistent usage ledger
come in later phases; until then each request's usage event is written to the log.

Streaming is a true passthrough: each SSE event is forwarded as it arrives. Tollgate
always asks the provider for the final usage chunk, but only forwards it if the client
asked for it too. If the client disconnects, the upstream request is cancelled and the
partial usage is recorded, estimated with tiktoken. A stream cut off by a gateway shutdown
is handled the same way and recorded as `gateway_shutdown`. An upstream failure after the first
event ends the stream with an OpenAI-style error event; a failure before it is a normal
HTTP error.

## Quickstart

```sh
docker compose up --build
curl -s localhost:8000/v1/chat/completions \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "hi"}]}'
```

The default stack routes every model to `mock_provider`, so no real keys are needed.
To use real providers, copy `.env.example` to `.env`, set
`PROVIDERS_CONFIG=config/providers.yaml` and fill in the keys.

```python
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI(base_url="http://localhost:8000/v1", api_key="anything")
client.chat.completions.create(model="gpt-4o-mini", messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "hi"}])

for chunk in client.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-4o-mini", messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "hi"}], stream=True
):
    print(chunk.choices[0].delta.content or "", end="")
```

## Mock provider

`mock_provider/` is a fake OpenAI-compatible server used by all tests and benchmarks.
Behaviour is set by env var at startup or per request with headers (`X-Mock-Latency-Ms`,
`X-Mock-TTFT-Ms`, `X-Mock-Tokens-Per-Sec`, `X-Mock-Fail-Rate`, `X-Mock-Fail-Mode`,
`X-Mock-Output-Tokens`, `X-Mock-Seed`). The same seed always produces the same output.
`GET /mock/stats` reports the tokens it served. See the docstring in
[mock_provider/app.py](mock_provider/app.py) for details.

## Development

```sh
python -m venv .venv && .venv/bin/pip install -e ".[dev]"
pytest --cov                  # everything, including perf checks
pytest -m "not perf" --cov    # what CI runs: perf checks depend on the machine
ruff check . && ruff format --check . && mypy
```
